		Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my personal website. My name is Christoph and I'm a software
		developer, data scientist, and tech enthusiast. I'm always looking to learn new things and push
		myself to be the best I can be, and this website is a way for me to share my journey with you.

		On this site, you'll find out a little bit more about me and what I 'm interested in. I'm really
		passionate about using technology to solve problems and make people's lives better, which is why
		I 've chosen to work in the tech industry. I've got a solid foundation in computer science and
		I'm skilled in a bunch of different programming languages and tools.

		I hope you find something interesting here and that you'll stick around for a while. Whether
		you're a tech enthusiast like me, a potential employer, or just someone who stumbled upon my
		website by accident, I'm glad you're here. If you've got any questions or just want to chat,
