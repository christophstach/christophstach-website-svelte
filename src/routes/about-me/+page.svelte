	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>
		I started software development at the age of 13. It quickly became a passion for me and I
		started to code my first small projects and websites. I found most interest in websites. These
		days they were still developed with HTML frame sets and some very basic
		<a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> scripts.
	</p>

	<p>
		I kept doing <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and also used it in some internships I did.
		After finishing an IT specialized business school and doing a German apprenticeship, I started
		my first job as TYPO3-developer (a popular PHP-based CMS-system). I even published some small
		extensions on the TYPO3 extension gallery. Later on, I switched job to a more generalized
		<a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>
		full-stack engineer. After working multiple years, I decided to quit and go traveling for a while.
		Then when coming back to Germany, I moved to Berlin where I started to studying at
		<a href="https://www.htw-berlin.de/">HTW Berlin</a>, a little later I started working as a
		frontend engineer in part-time. During my studies, I also found interest in developing methods
		of artificial intelligence with neural networks. Later I focused more on methods of
		bioinformatics, studying the creation of pipelines for next generation sequencing data.
	</p>
	<p>
		I always liked keeping up to date with current websites development practices. My main interest
		is the frontend part. I used many frameworks like <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>,
		<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>,
		<a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a>,
		<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>,
		<a href="https://www.solidjs.com/">SolidJS</a> and
		<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. As well as meta frameworks like
		<a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>,
		<a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>, and
		<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>.
